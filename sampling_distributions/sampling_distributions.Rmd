In this lab, we investigate the ways in which the statistics from a random 
sample of data can serve as point estimates for population parameters.  We're 
interested in formulating a *sampling distribution* of our estimate in order 
to learn about the properties of the estimate, such as its distribution.

## The data

We consider real estate data from the city of Ames, Iowa.  The details of 
every real estate transaction in Ames is recorded by the City Assessor's 
office.  Our particular focus for this lab will be all residential home sales 
in Ames between 2006 and 2010.  This collection represents our population of 
interest.  In this lab we would like to learn about these home sales by taking 
smaller samples from the full population.  Let's load the data.

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
require(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval=FALSE)
```

```{r load-data, eval=TRUE, results = "hide"}
download.file("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/ames.RData", destfile = "ames.RData")
load("ames.RData")
```



We see that there are quite a few variables in the data set, enough to do a 
very in-depth analysis.  For this lab, we'll restrict our attention to just 
two of the variables: the above ground living area of the house in square feet 
(`Gr.Liv.Area`) and the sale price (`SalePrice`).  To save some effort 
throughout the lab, create two variables with short names that represent these 
two variables.  And to emphasize that this data for *all* home sales in Ames 
from 2006--2010, we'll call the resulting data frame `Population`:

```{r assign, eval=TRUE}
Population <-
  ames %>%
  select(area = Gr.Liv.Area, price = SalePrice)
```

```{r, head-population}
head(Population)
```

Let's look at the distribution of area in our population of home sales by 
calculating a few summary statistics and making a histogram.

```{r area}
favstats(~area, data = Population)
histogram(~area, data = Population)
```

1.  Describe the distribution of house area in this population.

## The unknown sampling distribution

In this lab we have access to the entire population, but this is rarely the 
case in real life.  Gathering information on an entire population is often 
extremely costly or impossible.  Because of this, we often take a sample of 
the population and use that to understand the properties of the population.

If we were interested in estimating the mean living area in Ames based on a 
sample, we can use the following command to create a sample from the poplution.

```{r samp1}
Sample <- sample(Population, 50)
dim(Sample)
```

This command collects a simple random sample of size 50 from the population
and assigns it to `Sample`.
This is like going into the City 
Assessor's database and pulling up the files on 50 random home sales.  Working 
with these 50 files would be considerably simpler than working with all 2930 
home sales.

2.  Describe the distribution of home sizes in your sample sample. 
    How does it compare to the distribution of home sizes in the population?

If we're interested in estimating the average living area in homes in Ames 
using the sample, our best single guess is the sample mean.

```{r mean-samp1}
mean(~area, data = Sample)
```

Depending on which 50 homes you selected, your estimate could be a bit above 
or a bit below the sample mean above.  It's very unlikely that your sample mean
will be exactly the same as the population mean of 
`r round(mean(~area, data = Population), digits = 2)` square feet.
In general, though, the sample mean turns out to be a pretty good estimate of the average 
living area, and we were able to get it by sampling less than 3\% of the 
population.

3.  Take a second sample, also of size 50, and call it `Sample2`.  How does the 
    mean ares in `Sample2` compare with the mean area in `Sample2`?  
    
4.  Suppose we took two 
    more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. Which would you think 
    would provide a more accurate estimate of the population mean?

Not surprisingly, every time we take another random sample, we get a different 
sample mean.  It's useful to get a sense of just how much variability we 
should expect when estimating the population mean this way. The distribution 
of sample means taken from every possible sample, called the *sampling distribution*, 
can help us understand this variability. 

In this lab, because we have access to the population, we 
can approximate the sampling distribution by computing the sample mean for a large 
number of samples.  (*All* samples would take a *very* long time, even for a computer.)

Computing a single sample mean is easy:

```{r samp}
mean( ~area, data = sample(Population, 50))
```

But how can we compute, say, 5000 sample means, and put those results into a data frame 
to get a sampling distribution? We can use the `mosaic` function `do()`:

```{r loop}
SampleMeans50 <- do(5000) * mean( ~area, data = sample(Population, 50))
```

The `do()` function simply repeats a statement over and over 
and collects the results in a data frame. 

```{r head}
head(SampleMeans50)
histogram( ~ mean, data = SampleMeans50)
```

If you would like to adjust the bin width of your histogram to show a little more detail, 
you can do so by changing the `width` 
or `nint` (for **n**umber of **int**ervals) arguments.

```{r hist-breaks}
histogram( ~ mean, data=SampleMeans50, width=20)
histogram( ~ mean, data=SampleMeans50, nint=20)
```

4.  How many rows are there in `SampleMeans50`?  

5.  Describe your (approximate) sampling distribution, and be sure to 
specifically note its center.  

6.  Compare your (approximate) sampling distribution to the sampling distribution of 
a neighbor.  How similar are they?


7.  How much would you expect the distribution to change if we instead 
    collected 50,000 sample means instead of 5,000?

## Interlude: The `do()` function

Let's take a break from the statistics for a moment to let that last block of code sink in.  
The idea behind the `do()` function is *repetition*: it allows you to execute a line of code as 
many times as you want and puts the results in a data frame.  In the case above, we wanted to 
repeatedly compute the mean area from random sample of size 50.

Without something like the `do()` function, this would be painful. 
First, we'd have to compute each of the 5000 
sample means one line at a time, keeping track of each one as we went along.

```{r loop-long}
sample_means50 <- rep(NA, 5000)

sample_means50[1] <- mean(~ area, data = sample(Population, 50))
sample_means50[2] <- mean(~ area, data = sample(Population, 50))
sample_means50[3] <- mean(~ area, data = sample(Population, 50))
sample_means50[4] <- mean(~ area, data = sample(Population, 50))
# ...and so on, 5000 times
```

With the `do()` function, these thousands of lines of code are compressed into one line:

```{r do-again}
SampleMeans50 <- do(5000) * mean( ~area, data = sample(Population, 50))
```

Note that for each of the 5000 times we computed a mean, we did so from a **different** sample!

5.  To make sure you understand what the `do()` function does, try modifying the
    code to take only 25 sample means and put them in a data frame named
    `SampleMeans_small`. Display this data frame on your screen (type 
    `Sample_Means_small` into the console and press enter). How many rows 
    are there in `SampleMeans_small`? What does each row represent?

## Sample size and the sampling distribution

Mechanics aside, let's return to the reason we used the `do()` function: 
to compute (an approximation to) a sampling distribution, specifically, this one.

```{r hist}
histogram( ~ mean, data = SampleMeans50)
```

The sampling distribution that we computed tells us much about estimating 
the average living area in homes in Ames.  Because the sample mean is an 
unbiased estimator, the sampling distribution is centered at the true average 
living area of the the population, and the spread of the distribution 
indicates how much variability there is from sample to sample.

To get a sense of the effect that sample size has on our distribution, let's 
build up three sampling distributions: one based on samples of size 10, one
based on a samples of size 50, and another based on samples of size of 100.
We'll use `favstats()` this time becuase it records the sample size as well
as the mean.

```{r samp-10-100}
SampleMeans10 <-  do(5000) * favstats(~area, data=sample(Population, 10))
SampleMeans50 <-  do(5000) * favstats(~area, data=sample(Population, 50))
SampleMeans100 <- do(5000) * favstats(~area, data=sample(Population, 100))
```

We can put these all togehter in a single data frame using `bind_rows()`.  (This puts 
the rows of each data frame below the rows of the one before, making a data frame with
15000 rows.
```{r}
SamplingDists <- bind_rows(SampleMeans10, SampleMeans50, SampleMeans100)
dim(SamplingDists)
```

Finally, draw the histogram using the `|` formula notation. If you want to have the histograms stacked vertically rather than horizontally, use the `layout` argument. 

```{r }
histogram(~ mean | factor(n), data=SamplingDists, nint=20, layout=c(1,3))
```

1. When the sample size is larger, what happens to the center?  What about the spread?

## On your own

So far, we have only focused on estimating the mean living area in homes in 
Ames.  Now you'll try to estimate the mean home price.

-   Take a random sample of size 50 from `price`. Using this sample, what is 
    your best point estimate of the population mean?

-   Since you have access to the population, simulate the sampling 
    distribution for $\bar{x}_{price}$ by taking 5000 samples from the 
    population of size 50 and computing 5000 sample means.  Store these means 
    in a vector called `sample_means50`. Plot the data, then describe the 
    shape of this sampling distribution. Based on this sampling distribution, 
    what would you guess the mean home price of the population to be? Finally, 
    calculate and report the population mean.

-   Change your sample size from 50 to 150, then compute the sampling 
    distribution using the same method as above, and store these means in a 
    new vector called `sample_means150`. Describe the shape of this sampling 
    distribution, and compare it to the sampling distribution for a sample 
    size of 50.  Based on this sampling distribution, what would you guess to 
    be the mean sale price of homes in Ames?

-   Of the sampling distributions from 2 and 3, which has a smaller spread?  If
    we're concerned with making estimates that are more often close to the 
    true value, would we prefer a distribution with a large or small spread?
